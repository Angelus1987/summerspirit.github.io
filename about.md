I am a multi-faceted life-juggler that brings the hustle to whatever I do. I leverage abstract thinking with big ideas and am uniquely skilled to also build the tools to realize them. I will import the strategy to your movements to make forward-thinking change happen.
<br />
<br />
In other words: I'm not "just another dev". 
<br />
<br />

My primary programming ability is in Ruby and/on Rails, but I also have some front-end experience. I use my coding knowledge to inform my strategy decisions.
<br />
I am committed to civic participation, by any means necessary: from hacking to political debate, Twitter to poetry.  I have seen and personally evidenced that each of us can be the change we seek.

Teaching, mutual learning, and collaboration between all kinds of unlikely partners is a mechanism by which we can achieve these changes.  

If you need programming help, you can book me at AirPair or Codementor: <br/>

## I'm also happy to talk about:

* Poetry, prose and any other creative writing
* Volunteer, youth & civic engagement 
* Italy
* Cats
* Wonderment at the number of names we have for bacon, drunkenness and sorrow
