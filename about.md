I am a multi-faceted life-juggler that brings the hustle to whatever I do. I leverage abstract thinking with big ideas and am uniquely skilled to also build the tools to realize them. I will import the strategy to your movements to make forward-thinking change happen.

My programming capacities include:Ruby, and Rails....etc. I use my coding knowledge to inform my strategy decisions.

I am committed to civic participation, by any means necessary: from hacking to political debate, Twitter to poetry.  I have seen and personally evidenced that each of us can be the change we seek.

Teaching, mutual learning, and collaboration between all kinds of unlikely partners is a mechanism by which we can achieve these changes.  

If you need programming help, you can book me here: and here:
