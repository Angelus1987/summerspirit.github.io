## Porter = #fail. Luke = all the win.

### I travel. I hate everything. I meet the best taxi driver in the world. Luke wins big in Ottawa. 

Let's start at the end, because if you don't want to read this, I know I'll lose your attention in 10 seconds.

<br />
<hr />
I left my hotel Sunday at 7 a.m. I had to take a taxi because the shuttle doesn't run until 9. I had to wait 20 minutes for a metro because track repairs (but at least, unlike Toronto, it was still running). I had to wait 30 minutes for the airport bus from L'Enfant. Then that bus took 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Still, I somehow arrived a full hour before flight check-in.

I had a coffee and a Cinnabon. Life was pretty good. I return to the check-in line to find a line and a sign: Delayed. I check Twitter, which helpfully tells me all flights are grounded because all of Porter's computers are down. They have no further information.
<br />
The next few hours eventually escalated into an airline attendant cussing at me, ripping my boarding pass up and forcing me to the end of the line after I had found some way to get access to enough American cash to get on the plane, since 1. they didn't accept my Visa debit I had used to go from Toronto to D.C., and successfully used as a credit card at every single retailer, hotel, taxi and other service in D.C. and 2. they wouldn't take Canadian cash
<br />
Also, my Google Now knew a full 20 minutes before the flight attendants at the gate knew when boarding/departure would be. Thanks Google. WTF Porter?
<br />
The flight was so late I missed my meeting. It was grey and drizzling when I landed. Thankfully when I got off, I got the most amazing cabbie in the world. He let me rant. He gave me water. And then he said - "Miss, we are turning today around right now."
<br />
Then, this cabbie in a little hat, turned the Bollywood pop way up. Way way up. And he danced for me at all the red lights. There were so many red lights. He even showed me a neat double hand snapping trick.
<br />
Are you having a horrendous day? Just listen to some of this:
