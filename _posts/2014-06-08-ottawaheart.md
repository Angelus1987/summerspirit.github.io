## Porter = #fail. Luke = all the win.

### I travel. I hate everything. I meet the best taxi driver in the world. Luke wins big in Ottawa. 

Let's start at the end, because if you don't want to read this, I know I'll lose your attention in 10 seconds.

<h3>So what's this all about?</h3>
</p>
<a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/lucasjmoore" target="_blank">Luke</a>Luke is a phenomenal mobile dev and designer I met in my Rails bootcamp last summer. He just graduated from Algonquin College top of his class in the inaugural Mobile Dev and Design cohort. He was a PA during his time there, assisting first-year students with a variety of coding challenges, while also tackling his work, across platforms (Android, iOS - he went to conferences and learned some Windows for mobile). Tweet at him here: <a href="https://twitter.com/LucasJMoore" target="_blank">@lucasjmoore</a>

In his spare time he does beautiful macro photography for fun and makes mind-bending things with Photoshop.

He attended Start-Up Weekend Ottawa this weekend, and in 48 hours he and his team developed a fully functional business concept, income streams, a prototype and won.

I led a team in the Start-Up Social Enterprise Ottawa last summer at Hub Ottawa, and this is no easy feat. 

Their project, My Jam, won both the Best Design award and won the competition overall. Congrats!

There's something so exquisitely satisfying about celebrating the successes of those you're closest to. You just get to have the pure joy and celebration of a win, without any of the doubts you'd have about your own projects. There's no hang-ups about what more could have been done, about those couple of pieces you missed, about what's next. When you're celebrating those around you, you already knew they could do amazing feats and you're just happy they've conquered a mountain.

As for me today, I left my hotel Sunday at 7 a.m. I had to take a taxi because the shuttle doesn't run until 9. I waited 20 minutes for a metro because track repairs (but at least, unlike Toronto, it was still running). I waited 30 minutes for the airport bus from L'Enfant. That bus took 1.5 hours to get to the airport. Still, I somehow arrived a full hour before flight check-in.
<br />
<br />
I had a coffee and a Cinnabon. Life was pretty good. I returned to the check-in line to find a line and a sign: Delayed. I check Twitter, which helpfully tells me all flights are grounded because all of Porter's computers are down. They have no further information.
<br />
<br />
The next few hours eventually escalated into an airline attendant cussing at me, ripping my boarding pass up and forcing me to the end of the line after I had found some way to get access to enough American cash to get on the plane, since 1. they didn't accept my Visa debit I had used to go from Toronto to D.C., and successfully used as a credit card at every single retailer, hotel, taxi and other service in D.C. and 2. they wouldn't take Canadian cash
<br />
<br />
Also, my Google Now knew a full 20 minutes before the flight attendants at the gate knew when boarding/departure would be. Thanks Google. WTF Porter?
<br />
<br />
The flight was so late I missed my meeting. It was grey and drizzling when I landed. Thankfully when I got off, I got the most amazing cabbie in the world. He let me rant. He gave me water. And then he said - "Miss, we are turning today around right now."
<br />
<br />
Then, this cabbie in a little hat, turned the Bollywood pop way up. Way way up. And he danced for me at all the red lights. There were so many red lights. He even showed me a neat double hand snapping trick.
<br />
<br />
Are you having a horrendous day? Just listen to some of this:

Right now, this my jam ;)

Have a great night everyone.
