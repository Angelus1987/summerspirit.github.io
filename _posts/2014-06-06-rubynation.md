# Fly, baby dev, fly!

### Ruby Nation kicked off and one of my baby devs kicked my day off in a major awesome

While I was out grabbing a couple of drinks and heading back to my hotel (which had barely any internet), one of the Rails Girls was very busy changing her database to postgres and deploying to Heroku.

I found this tweet at the conference in the morning:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>With a huge help from <a href="https://twitter.com/Naomi_Freeman">@Naomi_Freeman</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhigley">@karlhigley</a>, I made this at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23RGDCWorkshop&amp;src=hash">#RGDCWorkshop</a> today: <a href="http://t.co/ZXWtgWQzxc">http://t.co/ZXWtgWQzxc</a> (many improvements needed!)</p>&mdash; Mai Nguyen (@mxngyn) <a href="https://twitter.com/mxngyn/statuses/474734814353182720">June 6, 2014</a></blockquote>

This is her very first Rails app! This is Day 1 of programming! I whole-heartedly disagree that it needs much improvement. She went above and beyond the guides. I coached her through part of it, but it was all on her initiative.

Almost immediately after seeing her tweet, this came through:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/mxngyn">@mxngyn</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Naomi_Freeman">@Naomi_Freeman</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhigley">@karlhigley</a> You&#39;re Learning so fast Mai ! Great work :) &#10;Post more accomplishments or send them to me on FB</p>&mdash; Aymane (@AymaneShuichi) <a href="https://twitter.com/AymaneShuichi/statuses/474864933528547330">June 6, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I was so proud and absolutely elated at her progress and other people taking interest in her work.

This absolutely cements all my feel good feelings about the workshop over the past 2 days.

### To be continued ...

There was so much going on at Ruby Nation. 

I have a full notebook and an empty blog. These things will have to come together soon. I almost feel like I should HootSuite/TweetDeck these conference posts out across time. I need to build Categories first. 

Well, Categories are built and even separating themselves in my directory. I just need the piece to loop through them and make them show up in filtered lists.

Theme of the blog: Liquid is new to me, but I'm absolutely certain there are a lot of positives about doing it this way.
